# Optimization-of-Website
Optimizing website for more accessability

## Motivation for this Porject

Wanting to know how HTML and CSS work together to make a website function.

## Reason for this Project

To learn how to add *efficency* and **accessibility** to some one else's code without changing how the website works.

## What I Learned from this Project

I learned a lot from this project but three things stood out the moset to me. I have listed them below
  
  * div should be used sparingly or not at all. Always use an element more specific if you can.
 
  * comment out code insted of erasing code when you are trying something. This will save your life if/when it breaks stuff.
  
  * You can not combine everything in CSS. It **WILL** break!
